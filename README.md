# embed-blocker
Block others ability to embed or iframe your website without server-side.

# What is this?
Just a small script that checks if the page is viewed in an iframe or embed instead of the original source.

# Good to know!
- This release uses Google Chrome's error page, instead of a custom one. So you'll see Google's "Refused to connect" error page.
